# Blender to OpenUSD Pipeline Demo
This project demonstrates a working pipeline to export 3D content from **Blender** into **OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description)** format, preserving geometry, animation, and scene hierarchy. It showcases a foundational understanding of USD-based workflows for real-time graphics, virtual production, and asset management.
