# Blender to OpenUSD Pipeline Demo
This project demonstrates a working pipeline to export 3D content from **Blender** into **OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description)** format, preserving geometry, animation, and scene hierarchy. It showcases a foundational understanding of USD-based workflows for real-time graphics, virtual production, and asset management.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (vX.X) with USD Export Add-on
- [Pixar USD SDK](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD)
- `usdview` for USD visualization
- Python 3.9+ for scene inspection
- *(WIP)* NVIDIA Omniverse Create for layered scene review

---

## âœ… Features Demonstrated

- âœ… Exporting mesh, materials, and animation from Blender to USD
- âœ… Scene composition using multiple `.usda` files (character, environment, lighting)
- âœ… Layered hierarchy and references
- âœ… Python script to parse and inspect USD scene structure
- âœ… Visual comparison between Blender and USD representations

---

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `blender_scene.blend` and export the scene as `.usda` using the USD add-on
3. Run:
   ```bash
   usdview exports/scene.usda
   ```
4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/inspect_scene.py
   ```

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How OpenUSD represents a 3D scene using **prims**, **layers**, and **composition arcs**
- How to structure modular scene exports (character/environment separation)
- How to inspect and manipulate a USD file with the **Python API**
- Importance of real-time asset pipelines and scenegraph architecture

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add lighting variants (e.g., day/night)
- Implement shader/material translation
- Integrate with Omniverse Create for more advanced previews
- Live-edit with Python and auto-reload in viewer
